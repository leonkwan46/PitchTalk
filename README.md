# PitchTalk

PitchTalk is a mobile application designed to facilitate safe and secure communication between private tutors, students, and parents/guardians. The app addresses critical issues related to trust and safety in education, especially in the context of private tutoring and online learning.

## Problem Statement

In recent years, the trust between students, parents/guardians, and teachers has been severely impacted by incidents of misconduct. The UK government has provided guidance to rebuild trust, but challenges remain, particularly for private tutors who may not follow the same guidelines as formal educators. The COVID-19 pandemic has further transformed the education landscape, increasing the need for secure communication between tutors and students.

Private tutors often provide their personal contact information to students, raising concerns about inappropriate behavior. This issue is prevalent in various regions, including Malaysia, Singapore, and the UK. To address these concerns and align with UK safeguarding guidelines, PitchTalk aims to create a secure communication platform for private tutors, students, and parents/guardians.
